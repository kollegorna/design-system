# Kollegorna Design System

Building something for Kollegorna? Good times and much success awaits you! Here's our design system that will get you going quick and easy.

## Prerequisite: Normalize.css

The design system should be used together with Normalize.css. If you've installed the design system with Bower (which you should) then [appleboy/normalize.scss](https://github.com/appleboy/normalize.scss) will have been downloaded for you.

If it for some reason hasn't then run this:

`$ bower install normalize-scss --save`

## Updating the Design System

If changes has been made to [kollegorna/design-system](https://github.com/kollegorna/design-system) then just run:

`$ bower update`
