# Kollegorna Design System

Building something for Kollegorna? Good times and much success awaits you! Here's our design system that will get you going quick and easy.

## Prerequisite: Normalize.css

The design system should be used together with Normalize.css. We've chosen not to bundle it so you need to make sure it's included in the application.

It's recommended that you use the Sass port: [JohnAlbin/normalize-scss](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss).

`$ bower install normalize-scss --save`
